<p>
<b>RGFA</b> is a Ruby gem, which provides an implementation of the
“Graphical Fragment Assembly” (GFA) format specification in Ruby.
It allows to conveniently parse, edit and write GFA files. Complex operations such as the separation of the
implicit instances of repeats and the merging of linear paths can be performed.
A typical application of RGFA is the editing of a graph, to finish the assembly of a sequence, using
information not available to the assembler.
</p>

<p>
<b>RGFATools</b> is a gem, dependent on the RGFA gem.
It extends the RGFA library, implementing graph operations, for which
custom tags are used (or, mp, rn) and assumptions are made,
 such as the presence of count information on segments
(RC/KC/FC tags). It also provides RGFA-based scripts, such as find_crisprs.rb,
 which allows to detect CRISPRs in a de Bruijn graph.
</p>

<p>
The <b>GFAdiff</b> program, which compares the information in two graphs, and
generate a report or a Ruby script documenting the transformation steps
between the graphs, is part of the RGFATools gem.
